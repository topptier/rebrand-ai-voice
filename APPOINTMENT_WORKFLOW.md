# Appointment CRUD and Booking Workflow

This document outlines the implemented appointment management system with CRUD operations and booking workflow.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Multi-tenant Appointment Management
- All appointments are scoped to the authenticated user's organization
- Row-level security (RLS) through organization_id filtering
- Secure data access using Supabase client

### 2. AppointmentModal Component (`src/components/AppointmentModal.tsx`)
- **Purpose**: Modal form for creating new appointments
- **Features**:
  - Form validation using react-hook-form and zod schema
  - Date picker with calendar component
  - Time selection with pre-defined business hours (9 AM - 5 PM)
  - Duration input with 15-minute minimum
  - Customer information fields (name, phone, email)
  - Optional notes field
  - Loading states and error handling

### 3. Appointments Page (`src/pages/Appointments.tsx`)
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive appointment management interface
- **Features**:
  - "Book Appointment" button that opens the modal
  - Statistics cards showing appointment counts by status
  - Full appointment list with all details
  - Status management buttons (Confirm, Complete, Cancel)
  - Delete functionality
  - Responsive design with loading states
  - Empty state with call-to-action

### 4. Updated useAppointments Hook (`src/hooks/useAppointments.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Centralized appointment data management
- **Features**:
  - Supabase integration for real database operations
  - CRUD operations: Create, Read, Update, Delete
  - Multi-tenant data filtering by organization_id
  - Real-time statistics calculation
  - Error handling with toast notifications
  - Loading states management

### 5. Updated AppointmentBooking Component (`src/components/dashboard/AppointmentBooking.tsx`)
- **Purpose**: Dashboard widget showing upcoming appointments
- **Updated for**:
  - New data structure from database
  - Status management integration
  - Proper date/time formatting

## Database Integration

### Appointment Table Structure
```sql
CREATE TABLE appointments (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  organization_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES organizations(id),
  customer_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  customer_phone TEXT NOT NULL,
  customer_email TEXT,
  scheduled_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
  duration_minutes INTEGER NOT NULL,
  status TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'scheduled' CHECK (status IN ('scheduled', 'confirmed', 'cancelled', 'completed', 'no_show')),
  notes TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### Multi-tenancy and Security
- All queries are filtered by `organization_id` from the authenticated user's profile
- RLS policies ensure users can only access their organization's data
- No direct table access without proper organization context

## Workflow

### Booking a New Appointment
1. User clicks "Book Appointment" button
2. AppointmentModal opens with form
3. User fills in customer details, date, time, and duration
4. Form validates data using zod schema
5. On submit, appointment is created in Supabase
6. Success toast notification shown
7. Modal closes and appointment list refreshes
8. New appointment appears in the list

### Managing Appointments
1. **Status Updates**: Users can move appointments through states:
   - scheduled → confirmed → completed
   - scheduled/confirmed → cancelled
2. **Delete**: Remove appointments completely
3. **View Details**: All customer information and notes displayed

### Real-time Updates
- Statistics automatically recalculate when appointments change
- List refreshes after any CRUD operation
- Toast notifications for all operations

## Routing

- **Main route**: `/` - Dashboard with appointment summary widget
- **Appointments route**: `/appointments` - Full appointment management page
- Both routes protected by AuthGuard requiring authentication

## UI/UX Features

- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile
- **Loading States**: Skeleton loaders during data fetching
- **Empty States**: Helpful messages when no appointments exist
- **Error Handling**: Toast notifications for errors
- **Consistent Styling**: Uses shadcn/ui component library
- **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation

## Code Organization

- **Separation of Concerns**: Logic in hooks, UI in components
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript integration with proper interfaces
- **Reusable Components**: Modal can be triggered from any component
- **Consistent Patterns**: Follows existing project conventions
- **Error Boundaries**: Graceful error handling throughout

## Testing the Implementation

To test the appointment workflow:

1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to the application: `http://localhost:8080`
3. Sign in with valid credentials
4. Navigate to `/appointments` or use the appointment widget on dashboard
5. Click "Book Appointment" to open the modal
6. Fill in the form and submit to create an appointment
7. Use status buttons to manage appointment lifecycle
8. Test delete functionality

The implementation provides a complete, production-ready appointment management system with proper multi-tenancy, security, and user experience.
